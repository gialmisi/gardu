\section{Motivation and connection to multi-objective optimization}
{\color{red}
Give a short informal introduction to the topic of MCDM from a MOO point of view.
Some existing algorithms can be given as an example, with a focus on interactive MOO methods, since by nature, 
they involve the DM's preferences, and therefore, can be viewed as MCDM tools.

\section{The decision maker and preference}
{\color{red}
What is meant by a decision maker, what can be expected of them, and what is assumed. Make it clear what a DM is in this thesis. Preference, as a concept, is also
discussed.
}
\section{Utility functions}
{\color{red}
The concept of modelling a DM's preference is presented in light of utility functions. Utility functions are presented, and the choice of
using utility functions to model preference are discussed..
The assumptions made in this thesis regarding utility functions are made clear. Also, a critical look at utility functions as preference models is given.
}
\section{Interactivity}
{\color{red}
What are the benefits of interactive MOO methods in light of MCDM and decision support, why not apriori or aposteriori?
The possibility for a DM to learn about the underlying MOO problem is mentioned as a benefit of interactive methods.
