\section{Why optimize?}
{\color{red}
What it is to optimize and why should we optimize? Some simple real-life examples.}
\section{Single-objective optimization}
{\color{red}
A formal, and general, presentation of a single-objective optimization problem.
}
\section{Multi-objective optimization}
{\color{red}
Like the previous section, but for MOO problems. A clear connection is made to the single-objective case. A real-life example is given to
introduce the reader to the topic, before the formalism (maybe in a separate sub-section before this section?)
}
\section{Pareto optimality}
{\color{red}
The concept of Pareto optimality is introduced, with a clear connection to MOO. It is also made clear what is meant by Pareto optimality in
this thesis.
}
\section{Solving optimization problems}
{\color{red}
Some methods for solving MOO problems are presented, with a focus on ASF. Brielfy describe a priori, a posteriori, and interactive methods.
Focus should be on interactive methods. Brief mention of evolutionary approaches, like NSGA. (mostly to show that the author is aware of other approaches.)
